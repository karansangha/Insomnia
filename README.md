# Insomnia
Insomnia is a macOS app that prevents your Mac from falling asleep and your screen from dimming.

This can be useful when:
- Doing a presentation at work
- Watching YouTube videos in non-fullscreen mode
- Cooking and having the recipe open on your computer
- Reading a long article without scrolling
- Using the screen to view live stats
- Monitoring progress on a long-running task
